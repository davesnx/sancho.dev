Everything needs to start at some point and here is mine. I suck at explaining myself and my english is far from good,
but I would love to share my thoughts about some topics that I found interesting, can vary from Software, Functional Programming, Reason, Products, People or anything, really.

I worked almost 7 years on the Software industry and there's a ton of stuff that I learned and a tone that I didn't, so I'm trying to write down some that comes to my head and it will push me understand those topis better.

So, the first thing would be presenting myself...

I'm David Sancho, currently living where I was born, in Barcelona, Spain. Have been on the internet quite a while and I’m still very fascinated about it.

I currently work as a Software Engineer remotely for [draftbit](https://draftbit.com) breaking the barrier between an idea and a mobile app. Before that, I worked at [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) for 5 years on the Renderer Team (also known as Form Experience) with an amazing team, [Stickbugs](https://stickbugs.dev) ♥️.

Aside from my job, I worked on many side projects and tried to learn new ways to solve problems that I couldn't before, and before joining draftbit I fell into the Reason Community. Where most of my projects are based on now.

A notorious mention is [styled-ppx](https://github.com/davesnx/styled-ppx) which is a *preprocessor extension that enables CSS-in-Reason and OCaml in a similar way than [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) does it in JavaScript, but Type safe.

Outside from the computer, I spend a lot of time training. I'm into Triathlon since I love running and cycling.

You can follow me on Twitter [@davesnx](https://twitter.com/davesnx) to know when I'm pushing stuff here.

Bye!

*preprocessor extension: Same as a Babel Macro, but for the OCaml compiler. [A brief intro](https://victor.darvariu.me/jekyll/update/2018/06/19/ppx-tutorial.html)
