Disclamer: You might found the need to create something dynamic, since many of use come from JavaScript and its nature it's a very dynamic language, but please don't writte everything as a ppx.

Hope we are mature enough to not fall into those traps, ppx (as any other Software ) solves one particular problem, not all.

<!-- explaining what jared said on the podcast Reason Town -->

# What's a ppx

<!-- - What is? [https://github.com/jccampagne/ocaml_ppx_extension_simple_tutorial](https://github.com/jccampagne/ocaml_ppx_extension_simple_tutorial) -->

You might have asked yourself: What are these `[%% ...]` or `[@@ ...]` expressions that I see in others people’s code? They look like decorators, but what they do? and what about a percent sign in the middle of a let declaration, as in `let%lwt`? What's that kind of syntax?

<!-- Mention fear -->

# Why it exists?

<!-- Get the story about OCaml compiler team creating the ppx solution for people who wanted to extend the compiler without affecting the development. -->

# How it works?

<!-- What are the proceses of the compiler -->
