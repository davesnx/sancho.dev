- **Intro:** Explain the DDD/Boundaries idea behind the Lean Architecture. Small example of a file-system.
- **Pros**:
    - Better collaboration: isolated changes, easier code reviews & less merge conflicts.
    - * Isolated changes have a lot of benefits: Easier to test
    - Better abstractions: Easy to move each domain folder into it's own library/service
    - Easy to understand the app within the folder structure
    - Easier to delete
    - Easier to extend (scales accordingly)
    - Easy to visualize internal dependencies
- **Cons**:
    - People are used to the language/framework/documentation example
    - Sometimes hard to find the right place to put the new thing (Needs a good knowledge of the system)
    - Usually end-up with a shared/common folder where can be very beneficial in many cases (to re-use code, etc) but can easy fall into the box of everything.
    - Some compiler or build tools might have hard using shared code.
- **Conclusions**: When it make sense & how to move from one to another.
