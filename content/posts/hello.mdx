Everything needs to start at some point and here is mine. I suck at explaining myself and my english is far from good,
but I would love to share my thoughts about some topics that I found interesting, can vary from Software, Functional Programming, Reason, Products, People or anything, really.

I worked almost 7 years on the Software industry and there's a ton of stuff that I learned and a tone that I didn't, so I'm trying to write down some that comes to my head, share them with the "world". Hoping will push me to understand those topics better!
