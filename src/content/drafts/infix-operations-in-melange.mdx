# Title

??

```prolog
let (>>=) = bind: 'a t -> ('a -> 'b t) -> 'b t

let (>|=) = map: 'a t -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b t

let (<&>) = join: 'a t -> 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t

```

# Content

### Describe what infix operators are, how are used in ReasonML/OCaml.

OCaml has this feature which is somewhat obscure and not always (or very briefly) mentioned in books and tutorials. Depending on the first character of a function, it can behave as an infix operator. This is a core feature of OCaml and many developers exploit it in order to achieve their goals.

- Explained in the manual [here](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/expr.html) and [here](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/lex.html#sec82).

So anyone can define such a function like this:

**`let** ( ***>** ) param1 param2 **=** calc_something param1 param2`

Which can later be used like `param1 *> param2`

Try to make sense of this concept before proceeding, as otherwise you will have a very hard time.

Try do explain what's possible now in ReasonML, and what can we do with Melange

# async/await

A little history “One of the most requested features from Reason/BuckleScript”.

`let%` or `async/await` for promises

Other use-cases:

- File path (`/`)

```css
let (===) = (a, b) => Expect.expect a |> Expect.toEqual b;

describe("formatFloat", () => {
  test("0.05", () => Format.orgTraffic(0.05) === toBe("0"));
};
```
