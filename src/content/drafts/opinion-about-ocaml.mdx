OCaml is a great language but a bad product. In contrast, TypeScript is a meh language but an amazing product: brilliant execution, brilliant adoption, perfect growth, clear mission and a huge market.

This is my rant before I install the new TypeScript version and stop drinking the cool aid, and a long explanation of why I invest my last 3 years working on OCaml and Reason (if it's just too bad)?

# OCaml is a product?

Let’s start by the obvious, OCaml is a product. (?)

OCaml is a language, a compiler, a community and a bunch of more things, but it’s a brand.

An as a brand I mean, there are thoughts that live in developers heads about experiences, opinions of others, expectations, tradeoffs and in general contact points with that brand.

If you don’t see it as a product, you either are against capitalism or you desire nieche languages to keep being nieche

# The greats of OCaml

First, let me start with the greats of OCaml

- The type-checker
- The experience with the type-checker
- The language is small
- Once you learn OCaml, you understand much better other languages, feels like a first principled language (because you learn ML stuff)
- There’s functional programming in the mix, but it doesn’t get in your way
- It keeps evolving, slowly but there’s both academic and companies pushing it forward
-

# What’s so bad about OCaml?

- extremly hard to extend
- tooling lacks xxxx
- language lacks xxx
- community lacks xxx
