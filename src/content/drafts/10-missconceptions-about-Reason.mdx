quirks of reason/ocaml that you might face when trying it out:

- unit at the end
- how ppxes work
- what does let%blbalbla even do?
- where are those infix operators? How can I read the interface?
- label arguments / optional arguments
- why `~f` appears in standard libraries (Containers, Js, etc)
    - [https://www.javierchavarri.com/data-first-and-data-last-a-comparison](https://www.javierchavarri.com/data-first-and-data-last-a-comparison/)
- nominal typing: variants vs polyvariants vs open polyvariants
- moar nominal typing: records vs objects (very rarely used but still)
- inference direction (from bottom to top). Showcase the simplest example, but later showcase the classic match statement that infers a more complex type such as `data list result`
