Everything needs to start at some point and here is mine.

I suck at explaining myself and my english is far from good, but I would love to share my thoughts about some topics that I found interesting, can vary from Software, Functional Programming, ReasonML, SaaS products, people or anything, really.

Worked almost 7 years on the Software industry and there's a ton of stuff that I learned and a lot to learn, so I'm trying to write down some stuff that comes to my head, share them with the "world". Hoping will push me to understand those topics better and teach someone a long the way.
