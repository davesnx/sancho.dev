Everything needs to start at some point and here am I.

I'm spanish, which means that I automatically suck at speaking in english. Aside, I struggle at explaining myself, but still I would love to share my thoughts on the internet about some topics that I found interesting.

The range of topics can vary from Software, Functional Programming, ReasonML, SaaS products, design, people or anything, really.

At the time of writting, I worked for almost 7 years on the Tech industry and there's a ton of stuff that I learned and planning to learn. So I will try to write down some stuff that comes to my head, share them here and hopefully it will push me to understand those topics better and, eventually teach someone a long the way.
