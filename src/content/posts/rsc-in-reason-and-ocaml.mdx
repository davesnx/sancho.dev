### Title: RSC in Reason and OCaml

- Minimum description on what’s RSC

**React Server Components**, strictly speaking, are **React components that run exclusively on the server**, they never run or are even hydrated on the client, in fact, **aren't even included, bundled with alongside client-side code**, and thus have **no client-side JavaScript bundle size impact**.

Running on the server enables components to have access to any server-resource such as the Database, Filesystem, etc. (maybe mention system stuff?).

which more importantly allows to stream the components, as data comes along
