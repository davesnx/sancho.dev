Let's be honest. You found a piece of technology that feels like a cheat code. Maybe it's a programming language like Rust, OCaml or Gleam. Maybe it's a library like Effect.ts that fundamentally changes how you handle state, or maybe it's a new framework like Hono or runtime like Bun. Whatever it is, it solves the problems that make you pull your hair out in your current stack. You're in the honeymoon phase, you are hyped and you want everyone else to see the light.

But then reality hits: you have to convince your colleagues, your manager, and the rest of the organization.

I've been on both sides of this table for over a decade. At Typeform, I navigated the complexities of migrating legacy systems while keeping the product shipshape. And now at Ahrefs, I work in an environment that runs entirely on OCaml—a choice that many would consider "niche" but is actually our superpower.

I've seen these migrations succeed spectacularly, transforming average teams into shipping machines. I've also seen them fail, burning social capital and leaving behind a mess of half-baked code.

Discussions about technology are, by and large, emotionally driven shouting matches based on anecdotes and gut feelings. If your strategy is to say "it's cool", "it's better", or "it has algebraic data types", you've already lost and you will probably become a meme.

This post outlines the best strategy for convincing your manager and colleagues to adopt a less known programming language or less common choice for a technology.

Warning: Do you really want this? Choosing the wrong tech stack is a high-stakes gamble. It can cost the company millions in rewrites, hiring difficulties, and lost time. For you personally? It could cost you your reputation, or even your job if you really mess it up.

On the flip side, if you execute this properly, it can transform an organization. Adopting a niche language can give your company a massive competitive advantage—hiring better engineers, shipping fewer bugs, and moving faster than competitors stuck in the "industry standard" mud. It can also fast-track your career.

So, how do you do it without becoming "that guy"?

The timeline I'm proposing has two main goals:
1. **Minimize risk**. Business decisions are about risk management. People come and go, but technical decisions stick around and are expensive to reverse. If you want a "yes," you need to show that the downside is capped.
2. **Prove the trade-offs are worth it**. Every technology has a cost. You need to demonstrate that the benefits (velocity, reliability, talent attraction) so clearly outweigh the costs that saying "no" becomes the silly decision.

Here is the timeline.

## 1. Become an expert (or at least not a meme)

Before you open your mouth, you need to know your stuff. I don't mean reading the "Getting Started" guide. I mean building real things.

Don't become the "Actually..." guy who interrupts conversations to say, "Actually, in Rust, this memory safety issue wouldn't exist." That's the fastest way to get ignored.

Instead, you need to be the person who knows the answer when things break. You need to understand:
- How does the deployment process look?
- What are the editor integrations like?
- What are the "known issues" that will bite us 6 months from now?
- Who do we contact in the community when we hit a wall?

Credibility is your currency here. If you can't answer the hard technical questions, you aren't ready to propose it.

## 2. Start small (Mitigate risk)

Your ego wants to rewrite the core product. Your ego says, "This is shiny, I want to use it on the most visible feature so I get promoted."

Ignore your ego.

Start with the internal tool that nobody cares about but everyone hates using. Maybe it's a script, a dashboard, or a small isolated component. The goal is to choose a project where **failure is an option**. If it doesn't work out, you should be able to throw it away with zero impact on the business.

This step is about proving the concept in *your* environment, with *your* constraints. It allows you to show a working example: "Look, this tool used to crash every week. Since I rewrote it in X, it hasn't crashed once."

## 3. Create a detailed adoption strategy

Once you have a small win, you need a plan. "We'll just figure it out" is not a strategy; it's a resignation letter waiting to happen.

You need to address the risks head-on:
- **What if you get hit by a bus?** (Or more likely, leave for a better offer). Who else knows this stack?
- **How do we hire for this?**
- **What is the "break glass" backup plan?**

For inspiration, I highly recommend reading Javier Chavarri's [adoption strategy for ReasonML](https://www.javierchavarri.com/adopting-reason-strategies-dual-sources-of-truth-and-why-gentype-is-a-big-deal). He emphasizes minimizing friction and having a clear path for gradual integration.

This is also where you bring up the **Python Paradox**. Coined by Paul Graham, it suggests that companies using less common languages often hire better programmers because those programmers care enough to learn tools outside the mainstream. By adopting a niche language, you aren't just changing syntax; you're filtering for curiosity and aptitude in your hiring pipeline.

## 4. Create allies within your organization

You cannot be a lone wolf. If you are the only person advocating for this, you will fail.

You need to build a coalition. How?
- **Teach others**: Organize a "brown bag" lunch or a coding dojo.
- **Solve their pain**: Don't sell features; sell pain relief. Show a colleague how the new language solves that bug they spent three days debugging last week.
- **Share excitement**: Drop interesting articles or small snippets in Slack—not to be annoying, but to spark curiosity.

Identify who else on the team is open to new ideas. Get them to write a few lines of code. Once you have 2-3 other engineers saying, "Hey, this is actually pretty nice," the conversation with management changes from "Dave's crazy idea" to "The engineering team's recommendation."

## 5. Apply the language where it truly shines

Don't force the square peg into the round hole just because you like the peg.

If you are adopting Elm, use it for that complex, state-heavy form that is always buggy. Don't use it for a static marketing page. If you are adopting OCaml, use it for the mission-critical business logic, not for a simple script that needs 50 different npm packages.

You need to choose projects that align with the language's core strengths so that the benefits are obvious. Then, measure the improvements.
- "We reduced runtime errors by 90%."
- "We refactored this module in half the time."
- "Performance improved by 2x."

Managers love metrics. Give them numbers that prove the investment was worth it.

## 6. Share it with the world

Finally, once you've succeeded (or failed!), write about it.

Write a blog post (like "How to convince your manager to adopt a niche programming language"). Speak at a meetup. Contributing back to the ecosystem helps validate your company's choice. It puts your company on the map as a place where interesting tech happens, which feeds right back into the "hiring better engineers" point from step 3.

Plus, it feels pretty good to say, "I told you so."
