This post outlines the best strategy for convincing your manager and colleagues to adopt a less known programming language or less common choice for a technology.

Warning, do you really want it? Using the wrong tech, or choosing the wrong stack, can cause you the job? maybe the reputation if you really fuck it up. Or the company can spend millons of dollars in time and resources. It’s really slow.

On the other side, if you really do it properly can transform an organitzation. It can potentially giving your company a competitive advantatge. It can also, transform your career.

Code bad in x, if you migrate to y. why do you think code with y is better?

tldr:

1. Become an expert
    1. Don’t become the AcTualLy gUy
    2. or at least don’t become a meme

    Before proposing a new programming language to your team and manager, it's crucial to b an expert. This expertise will lend credibility to your proposal and enable you to address concerns effectively. Here's how to build and demonstrate your expertise

    - Build real projects using the language
    - Understand deployment processes and best practices
    - Know the language's strengths and limitations
    - Be prepared to answer technical questions confidently
    - Know who to contact when
2. Start small
    - Mitigate Risk
    - Begin with an internal tool or non-critical component
    - Choose a project that showcases the language's strengths
    - Set clear success criteria and evaluation metrics
    - (Do you know this little tool that nobody cares? Yes, that one! But there’s the core of the business and it’s shiny. My ego is asking me to do it, I will get promoted)
3. Create a detailed adoption strategy
    - Minimize risks: what if it fails? What If you leave? What if everything breaks? What if everybody hates it?
    - Outline learning resources (e.g., Elm's excellent documentation)
    - Define a gradual integration approach
    - Establish a backup plan in case of setbacks

    For inspiration, review successful adoption stories like Javier Chavarri's ReasonML strategy: [Adopting Reason: Strategies, Dual Sources of Truth, and Why GenType is a Big Deal](https://www.javierchavarri.com/adopting-reason-strategies-dual-sources-of-truth-and-why-gentype-is-a-big-deal)

    - Demitigate doubts: Explain python paradox

    The "Python Paradox," coined by Paul Graham, suggests that companies using less common languages tend to hire better programmers. But how can you introduce a niche language to your existing team?
4. Create allies within your organization
    - Teach other people
    - Share exciting features and potential benefits
    - Organize informal learning sessions or coding dojos
    - Highlight how the new language could improve productivity or solve existing pain points
        - Decide what’s the next component you will help migrate
5. Apply the language where it truly shines
    - Ensure to keep
    - Choose projects that align with its core strengths
    - Demonstrate measurable improvements (e.g., performance, reliability, development speed)
    - Share success stories and metrics with the wider team
6. Share it with the world (and write a blog post like “How to convince your manager and your team to adopt a niece programming language”)
7. ???
8. Profit

# Conclusion

Introducing a niche programming language can be challenging, but with the right approach, it can bring significant benefits to your team and organization. By building expertise, mitigating risks, planning carefully, fostering advocacy, and showcasing strengths, you can successfully introduce a new language and potentially gain a competitive advantage in the process.
