During the pandemic, I worked on a side-project called [styled-ppx](https://styled-ppx.vercel.app) that eventually got me into Ahrefs. Javi, who I now consider a close friend, helped me with the setup and explained a bunch of concepts about the OCaml ecosystem. He worked (and still does) at Ahrefs, which is how I got to know the company better.

Fast forward 4 years, and it truly feels like I've found my dream job. While that phrase usually sounds idealistic or silly, this role is exactly what I always wanted: working on projects driven by passion, tackling big problems with complete autonomy, and building Open Source software with "the community" in mind while a team of users benefit from the iterations.

But the reason I love it isn't just the autonomy or the stack. It's because I found a place that breaks almost every rule of the modern tech startup handbook.

Here are three flexes about why we're different, and three humbling lessons I've had to learn the hard way.

# The Flexes

## 1. The Efficiency Ratio
Most companies tackling internet-scale problems have thousands of engineers. We have about 120, and we have no plans to grow much beyond that.

Let that sink in. We run one of the most active crawlers in the world, processing 5 million pages every minute—around 7 billion pages daily. We compete directly with tech giants like Google and Bing in crawling capacity. Yet, we maintain the agility of a small startup.

This isn't an accident; it's a choice. We don't hire to "scale culture" or to fill seats for a new funding round. We stay deliberately small, which forces us to be extremely good at our craft and choose technology that amplifies individual output, not just headcount.

## 2. The Unapologetic Monolith
Our secret weapon? We use OCaml for everything. Yes, everything. The backend, the frontend, the crawler, devops, internal tools, and even our CI pipelines.

While the rest of the industry chases the "JS framework of the month," we built a truly unified tech stack. Our REST endpoints share the exact same type definitions as our frontend. Our SSR server reuses the same React components as the client. Change a type definition in the database, and the compiler immediately flags every usage across the entire stack—from API responses to UI components.

Here's a concrete example: last month I added a new field to our backlink data structure. The compiler flagged 47 locations that needed updates. No runtime surprises, no "undefined is not a function" in production. Just compile-time safety end-to-end.

We even use the same package manager (opam) and build system (dune) for everything. A newcomer learns one way of thinking and can suddenly contribute anywhere in the codebase. It’s the ultimate antidote to context switching.

## 3. The Anti-VC Mindset
Our CEO codes. Our CTO codes. They aren't spending their days in board meetings with VCs or polishing pitch decks for the next exit. They are in the codebase, reviewing PRs, and solving problems.

This is possible because we are bootstrapped. We have no external pressure to hit arbitrary growth metrics. I’ve worked at companies where roadmaps were shaped by investor anxiety. Here, if something is technically interesting and solves a real problem for our users, we build it.

We are also "NIH (Not Invented Here) maxing." In a small ecosystem like OCaml, building for the long term often means owning your dependencies. We build most critical pieces in-house. It sounds extreme to some, but I'd rather modify and maintain code I understand than trust a black-box library I can't fix when it breaks at 3 AM.

# The Learnings

## 1. Politeness is High Latency
The culture at Ahrefs is a mix of international perspectives with strong Eastern European roots. It is direct, pragmatic, and rational above all else.

Coming from Spain, this caught me completely off guard. I was used to the "compliment sandwich"—wrapping criticism in praise to soften the blow. At Ahrefs, if your solution is flawed, someone will simply write: "This won't scale. Try approach B."

No emoji cushioning. No "great effort, but..." just facts.

At first, I took it personally. I thought people were being mean. But after a few months, I realized the truth: sugar-coating is high latency. Directness is actually respectful of everyone's time. When you strip away the emotional padding, you iterate faster. The feedback isn't about *you*; it's about the *code*. Once I unlearned my need for validation, I started doing the best work of my career.

## 2. The "Works on My Machine" Delusion
Most of my work involves building tools for other engineers—libraries, compilers, build systems. It is dangerously easy to fall in love with a prototype.

I used to spend two weeks building something elegant that worked perfectly in my local environment, thinking I was 90% done. Then came integration. Half my assumptions were wrong. The API didn't fit real-world use cases. Edge cases I hadn't imagined broke everything.

I had to learn that the prototype is maybe 10% of the job. Real engineering is the "boring" 90% that follows: handling the messy reality of production, writing documentation, teaching the team how to use it, and ensuring it survives the chaos of a large monorepo.

If it works on my machine but isn't robust enough for the team to rely on, it’s not engineering—it’s just a hobby.

## 3. Remote Trust is Analog
We work remotely, spread across five time zones. But I've learned that you can't build deep trust with an avatar.

Ahrefs understands this. We spend significant money sponsoring conferences like ICFP and React Alicante, and organizing ski retreats to bring the team together. These aren't just "team bonding" perks; they are critical infrastructure.

When you've seen someone fight for their ideas at 3 AM in a hotel lobby, or shared a meal with them after a long day of skiing, the remote dynamic changes. Back on Slack, their direct feedback no longer feels cold. You hear their actual voice. You know they are challenging your code because they care, not because they're being difficult.

Trust is analog. We just use digital tools to maintain it.

# Final Thoughts
Ahrefs isn't a typical company, and it definitely isn't for everyone. It requires a thick skin, a love for functional programming, and a willingness to take ownership that goes beyond a job description.

But for me, it’s been a masterclass in what happens when you strip away the startup theater and focus entirely on the craft. I may have joined for the OCaml, but I stayed for the relentless pursuit of doing things the right way, even—or especially—when it’s not the easy way.
