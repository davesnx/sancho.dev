I have been working at ahrefs for the past four years, and it truly feels like I’ve found my dream job. While the concept of a dream job sounds idealistic and silly, far from a perfect job, this looks like the job I always wanted.

I work on projects that don't feel like work, challenging big problems with complete autonomy, and everything is Open Source and build with "the community" in mind.

We're fully remote across the world, which has completely changed my life. I spend the winter in the Pyrenees, locked in, skiing and peacfully enjoying nature, while the summers are for trail running and cycling closer to family in Barcelona (Spain).

I want to take a moment to reflect and share what I have learned here, since it's one of the most unusual companies I've encountered, and I want to explain what I mean by that in this post and share my learnings.

If I ever feel a bit sad or nostalgic because it ended, I could eventually return to this post and smile.

# What’s ahrefs?

Let me explain first, what’s the company about and why is it a rare place. Eventually I will get to the learnings.

Only marketing people, SEO specialists and OCaml fans have heard of [ahrefs.com](http://ahrefs.com).

We’re one of the top SEO tools in the world, helping users improve their search rankings on Google, Bing, YouTube, Amazon, and now OpenAI and co. To show off a bit the numbers, ~45% of the S&P 500 use us and we have ~50.000 clients between them Facebook, NIKE, Adobe, IBM or Pinterest.

In short, we actually crawl the entire web and organise all that raw data into useful insights via different tools and reports. Those tools are used by people to analyze: the world, their own web, their competitor's web, rankings, authority, and a million other things; and eventually get more traffic from search engines.

Lately we released Web analytics <https://ahrefs.com/web-analytics>, we have our own search engine called [Yep.com](http://Yep.com), which is still in beta and building other small AI projects such as Wordcount ([wordcount.com](http://wordcount.com)) or Brand radar.

It's worth noting that as with any powerful tool, there are bad actors. Some practitioners employ SEO tactics that prioritize clickbait over substance, crafting those awful headlines like "Top 10 moments from last night's event, you won't believe number 7!". They're honestly one of the worst things about the internet. But we've built something genuinely useful for anyone seeking to establish a meaningful presence online. How our tools are used ultimately reflects the intentions of those who use them.

# The underdog company

Before joining, I only knew that the company was doing “*SEO with OCaml stuff*” with just a few people and competing directly with tech giants like Google, Bing and XXX in crawling.

Most of those companies (tackling internet-scale problems) have thousands of engineers. We are ~120 and have no plans to grow above that line. This caught my attention immediately. Staying small seemed challenging but fascinating.

We run one of the most active crawlers (source), processing around 6 billion pages daily and storing XX petabytes of web data. Despite this genuinely staggering scale, we maintain the agility and focus that only comes from staying deliberately small, being extremly good at our craft and choosing the right tech.

# The tech

Our secret? Everything is written in OCaml. The backend, frontend, crawler, devops, internal tools, and even the CI.

The short answer for why OCaml (and as brief as I can be, since I’m not entitled enough) was that we needed an expressive and performant language on the crawler and it went extremely well, so well, that it spread across the entire backend and eventually the frontend.

Originally, we had PHP as our backend, but after using OCaml for our crawler, it quickly took over the entire backend stack. On the frontend, we were using React, and at that point we had to choose between TypeScript (or Flow, remember that?) and Reason. Since Reason is essentially OCaml with JavaScript-friendly syntax sharing the same type system, semantics, tooling, and ecosystem.. adopting it was a no-brainer.

This gave us something powerful: a truly unified tech stack.

Our REST endpoints share the exact same type definitions as our frontend. Our SSR server reuses the same React components as the client. Our data validation logic runs identically on both sides. This creates a single source of truth: change a type definition once, and the compiler catches mismatches across the entire stack.

But this isn't just about type-safety or sharing code. We use the same package manager (opam), the same build system (dune), the same LSP for our editor, and deploy everything through a single pipeline. One language to learn, one mental model to master. It lowers the learning and the context switching. A newcomer joins the team, learns a single way of thinking, and suddenly they can contribute anywhere.

While Reason is the language of choice for the frontend, we use Melange to compile to JavaScript. We're actually one of Melange's main sponsors, and I'm part of the core team - but more on that later.

Aside from the unusual language of choice, there’s another particularity that didn’t surprise me when I met the team. The engineering team is pretty much NIH maxxing.

 In a small ecosystem like OCaml, building for the long term means owning your dependencies. We use some third-party tools like ClickHouse and buildkite, but most pieces are built in-house. It sounds extreme, but I'd rather modify and maintain code I understand than trust something I can't control.

# Learnings

Finally, the learnings. Might be highly personal and contextual but still somehow applicable in other places.

## Bootstrap companies rock

The CEO makes decisions based on his view of the company, the market. Appears in technical discussions, shares his quiet view. Pushes products and pushes the team forward without external pressure. Previously I have been in companies where entire roadmaps gets shaped by investors opinions, which conflicted with CEO's vision of companies.

## Remote but not strangers

There's a clear personal barrier with remote working. The person who has been reviewing your code for years, it's only an avatar and luckly they have their face.

This could be isolating and counter-productive, but ahrefs does something clever here. Being profitable (very profitable, actually) and tech-focus means we can invest in sponsoring events such as (ICFP)[link], (fun-ocaml)[link] or (React Alicante)[link] and bringing the team together. Also, we do one ski retreat per year and other hacking-together events.

These gatherings transform our remote culture. Back home, when someone challenges your PR, you hear their actual voice in your head, not some imagined critical tone. You know they're coming from a place of wanting the best solution because you've seen them fight just as hard for their own ideas at 3 AM in some conference hotel lobby.

## The culture can be daunting

The culture is a mix of international people but with eastern european roots, inherit from our Ukrainian founders. Direct communication, pragmatism, rationality over anything else.

Being async-first shapes everything. Discussions happen in public threads that might run for weeks. No quick Slack DMs or hallway conversations - everything is written, searchable, and thoughtful. This forces precise communication and builds trust across time zones.

Coming from Spain, this caught me completely off guard. I'd worked at two US-culture companies before, where feedback came wrapped in compliment sandwiches and party emojis. The Spanish way? We soften criticism with warmth. At Ahrefs? Pure, unfiltered directness.

Here's what I mean: If your solution has problems, someone will simply write "This won't scale. Try approach B instead." No emoji cushioning, no "great effort but...", no paragraph explaining how valued you are before the critique. In most places, even terrible solutions get celebrated with "Good start! 🎉" followed by gentle suggestions.

At first, this felt harsh. But after a few months, I could confidently say it's incredibly effective. The solution isn't attached to your identity neither personality, it's just code or decisions that can be improved. Once you internalize this, you iterate faster with actually valuable feedback instead of decoding what people really think.

This efficiency extends everywhere. With less than 1 hour of meetings per week, I can actually focus on solving hard problems instead of talking about solving them.

## Being technology first

Our CEO codes, our CTO codes. By focusing in OCaml, we are able to hire talented people.

By bringing passionate people together it generates great solutions and great energy. server-reason-react was born out of passion and to face a big challenge, that eventually payed off.

## There’s a mile between prototyping and engineering

Real engineering is done when the integration, edge cases, errors and a teaching the team is made. Meanwhile this doesn’t happen, everything is still beta and lives in the world of ideas.

We got hired to solve issues, engineering does that. Prototyping or ideating or even researching it’s just the 10% needed, but half of the half of the job
