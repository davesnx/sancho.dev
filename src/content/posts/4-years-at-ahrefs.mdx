I've been working at Ahrefs for the past four years, and it truly feels like I've found my dream job. While that phrase usually sounds idealistic and silly, this role is exactly what I always wanted: working on projects driven by passion, tackling big problems with complete autonomy, and building Open Source software with "the community" in mind.

We're fully remote across the world, which has completely changed my life. I spend my winters in the Pyrenees, locked in, skiing and peacefully enjoying nature. My summers are for trail running and cycling closer to family in Barcelona.

I want to take a moment to reflect on what I've learned here. It's one of the most unusual companies I've encountered, and I want to explain what I mean by that and share my learnings.

If I ever feel sad or nostalgic because it ended, I could return to this post and smile.

# The underdog

Only marketing people, SEO specialists, and OCaml fans have heard of [ahrefs.com](https://ahrefs.com).

We're one of the top SEO tools in the world, helping users improve their search rankings on Google, Bing, YouTube, Amazon, and now the AI search engines. To show off a bit: about 45% of the S&P 500 use us, including Facebook, Nike, Adobe, IBM, and Pinterest.

In short, we crawl the entire web and organize all that raw data into useful insights via different tools and reports. Those tools are used by people to analyze the world, their own web, their competitor's web, rankings, authority, and a million other things—and eventually get more traffic from search engines.

Here's the kicker: companies tackling internet-scale problems usually have thousands of engineers. Google has tens of thousands. We have about 120, and we have no plans to grow beyond that.

We run one of the most active crawlers in the world, processing around 6 billion pages daily and storing petabytes of web data. Despite this genuinely staggering scale, we maintain the agility that only comes from staying deliberately small and being extremely good at our craft.

Before joining, I only knew the company was doing "SEO with OCaml stuff" with just a few people and competing directly with tech giants like Google and Bing in crawling capacity. That paradox caught my attention immediately. Staying small seemed challenging but fascinating.

# The tech (NIH maxxing)

Our secret? Everything is written in OCaml. The backend, frontend, crawler, devops, internal tools, and even the CI.

The short answer for why OCaml is that we needed an expressive and performant language for the crawler, and it went extremely well—so well that it spread across the entire backend and eventually the frontend.

Originally, we had PHP as our backend. But after using OCaml for our crawler, it quickly took over the entire stack. On the frontend, we were using React, and we had to choose between TypeScript (or Flow, remember that?) and Reason. Since Reason is essentially OCaml with JavaScript-friendly syntax—sharing the same type system, semantics, tooling, and ecosystem—adopting it was a no-brainer.

This gave us something powerful: a truly unified tech stack.

Our REST endpoints share the exact same type definitions as our frontend. Our SSR server reuses the same React components as the client. Our data validation logic runs identically on both sides. Change a type definition once, and the compiler catches mismatches across the entire stack.

But this isn't just about type-safety or sharing code. We use the same package manager (opam), the same build system (dune), the same LSP for our editor, and deploy everything through a single pipeline. One language to learn, one mental model to master. A newcomer joins the team, learns a single way of thinking, and suddenly they can contribute anywhere.

Aside from the unusual language choice, there's another particularity that didn't surprise me when I met the team: we are NIH maxxing.

In a small ecosystem like OCaml, building for the long term means owning your dependencies. We use some third-party tools like ClickHouse and Buildkite, but most critical pieces are built in-house. It sounds extreme, but I'd rather modify and maintain code I understand than trust a black-box library that breaks at 3 AM.

# Bootstrap freedom

Ahrefs is bootstrapped. No VCs, no board meetings, no arbitrary growth metrics to hit.

Our CEO makes decisions based on his view of the company and the market. He appears in technical discussions, shares his quiet view, and pushes products forward without external pressure. I've been at companies where entire roadmaps got shaped by investor anxiety, which constantly conflicted with the CEO's actual vision. Here, that conflict doesn't exist.

Being profitable—very profitable, actually—means we can invest in what matters. We sponsor conferences like ICFP, fun-ocaml, and React Alicante. We're one of the main sponsors of Melange (the compiler we use for our frontend), and I'm part of its core team. We can take long-term bets on technology because we don't have to justify every decision to someone optimizing for the next funding round.

Our CEO codes. Our CTO codes. They're not spending their days polishing pitch decks; they're in the codebase, reviewing PRs, solving problems. By focusing on OCaml, we attract a specific kind of engineer—people who care deeply about their craft. Bringing passionate people together generates great solutions and great energy. Projects like server-reason-react were born out of that passion, to face a big challenge that eventually paid off.
