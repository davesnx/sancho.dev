## Why am I doing this?

- because it's fun (learning is fun, creating tools is fun and going deep is fun)
- if I build something useful on top of great fundamentals (ocaml type-checker and melange) the possibilities are big
    - DX (confidence, fast shipping, LSP, fun with LLMs)
    - performance (native perf could fix some of the issues with SSR, for example)
    - new patterns can appear for React with ocaml effects, at least the Suspense implementation would be different, but even user code
- to assemble a small group of hackers
- I’m passionate about integration between frontend and backend
- I’m being payed

## Why should I stop?

- Building tooling is sometimes very frustrating
- TS won, it might not be a better language but it’s absolutely a better product, it’s everywhere
- There’s too much to build if I want to have a production-ready on par with the features with JS stack
    - hot module reload (requires touching the build system, which may be hard)
    - implementing a router (server side routing is easy, client side routing seems very hard)
- There are clearly limitations to OCaml
    - package manager and build system are bad
    - community isn’t focused on web (even thought we have seen many people working on this, fundamentals are there)
    - OCaml compiler isn’t focused on UX
    - OCaml community isn’t focused on shipping and sharing
    - JaneStreet wants to change OCaml to be on pair with Rust
    - the development of OCaml (the language) is slow

## What I’m looking for

- Showcase the implementation
    - client components
    - async components
    - Suspense
- Discuss concepts
- Router implementation
- React esbuild plugin?

- React.cache
- optimsations for inline scripts on chunks
- Next prerendering (dinamic-io)
