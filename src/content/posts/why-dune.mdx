## Fast description

Explain why dune is needed on the first place. Take the https://github.com/chenglou/intro-to-reason-compilation explanation and retro-fit it into a blog post.

- [dune](https://github.com/pveber/ocaml-cookbook/blob/main/dune.readthedocs.io) is a program that helps compiling OCaml code into executables (or libraries, see below)
- you provide a description of your project in text files, and `dune` figures out the proper way to call the compiler from it.
- • for instance in `dune`, you can specify that your program depends on a library `bar`, and `dune` will look at a conventional location for a description of that library, and use it to generate proper calls to `ocamlc`/`ocamlopt`
