Everything needs to start at some point and here is mine. I suck at explaining myself and my english is far from good,
but I would love to share my thoughts about some topics that I found interesting, can vary from Software, Functional Programming, Reason, Products, People or anything really.

<!-- Presenting myself seems a right step, so I'm **David Sancho** from **Barcelona, Spain** and have been on the internet quite a while.

I'm a Software Engineer currently working remotely for [draftbit](https://draftbit.com). Before drafbit, I worked at [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com) for 5 years on the Renderer Team (also known as Form Experience) with an amazing team, [Stickbugs](https://stickbugs.dev) ♥️.

Aside from my job, I worked in many side projects, I will talk more about those in the future, but I recently shared in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davesnx/status/1249772395658960897) my latest:

[styled-ppx](https://github.com/davesnx/styled-ppx) a preprocessor extension that enables CSS-in-Reason and OCaml in a similar way than [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) does it in JavaScript.

If _**JavaScript**_, _**CSS-in-X**_, _**Reason**_ or _**ppx**_ sound familiar to you or you want to know more, great! since I plan to write a lot about those things, hope to see you soon!

Bye!
