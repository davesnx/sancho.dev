The main challenge was to create a unified design language and provide tools and assets to designers and developers so that they can further evolve the product. This language would be used by designers every day so they would need to contribute to its definition. I personally wanted to build all this without slowing down any other projects.

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~


The context and constraints for this decision are quite nuanced and in some cases involve knowledge about concepts that are foreign for most of us, like how compiler inference works, or advanced composition techniques in functional programming.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```reason
let make = (~pro) => {
  lola(pro);
}
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
